# tinynet

Very small neural network and machine learning library I'm creating while learning it myself. 


main.py contains an example usage with some example dataset from keras, so thats a dependency. 

Other than that numpy is the only dependency. 

The scores on the example task are terrible (around 50% - aka worse than random) so dont expect anythin yet. I think the problem is the backpropagation algorithm.
