# tinynet

Very small neural network and machine learning library I'm creating while learning it myself. 


the \*example.py files contain examples for some problems/datasets. 

Numpy should be the only dependency other than sklearn for some dataset splitting/shuffling.

The scores on the sklearn dataset is now actually amazing. Although it might be overfitting or something, still needs evaluation. XOR problem looks fine
